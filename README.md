# Sta521 Lab1  9/4/2017

In this lab 

* we will cover using RStudio on Saxon or a laptop
* demonstrate RNotebooks  (for more info see the [RStudio page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html#version_control))


For why Reproducible Research is important read [Yihui's post](https://yihui.name/en/2012/06/enjoyable-reproducible-research/)  (and watch the video in the blog about what happened at Duke when RR was not used!)


To get started:  
   1) open RStudio on your laptop or if you have a StatSci account open RStudio on Saxon  [http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787](http://saxon.stat.duke.edu:8787) and login with your Duke netid and password.
   2) Create a new Project.  In RStudio, click on New Project in the file menu.
         If you have installed `git` (see Resources on git on the course website or Bootcamp info below) you may clone the Lab1 repository: select Version Control, then Git. Enter https://github.com/STA521-F17/Lab1.git in the  Repository URL field, provide a name for the project, e.g. 'lab1', and select a directory to save your work, e.g. Lab1   If you have not set up git, then create the project in an existing or new directory.  We suggest that you make a folder for STA521 to save your work for the course.
  3) Save the [lab1.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STA521-F17/Lab1/master/lab1.Rmd) file to your project directory created above if you did not clone the repository.
  4) On the lower right panel in RStudio, click on the Files tab. You should see a listing of the files in your directory. Click on `lab1.Rmd` to open it in the RStudio editor and then follow instructions there.
